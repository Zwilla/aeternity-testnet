%We want channel that are using the same contract to be able to calculate a contract hash that is the same. This makes it easier to tell if 2 channels are betting on the same thing.
%Each contract should output an amount between 0 and constants:channel_granularity(), which is the portion of the money that goes to one of the participants. Which participant it signifies depends on what value is stored in a flag.
%So each contract needs a value saying how much of the money is locked into that contract.
