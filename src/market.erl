%we need a smart contract for the trust-free markets for financial derivatives.
%It acts as an order book.
%the market maker has to publish the price periodically, every trade is matched at the earliest price possible.
%If the market maker publishes a price early, he loses every bet. Delay = 0, nonce = big
%If the market maker publishes contradictory prices at the same time, he loses every bet. delay = 0, nonce = big
%if the market maker failes to publish by a certain point in time, then everyone can take all the money from the channels. delay = low, nonce = big. 

%The contract involves verifying the market maker's signature, and checking that the thing that was signed is correctly formatted.

%First we should write the contract for a bet based on the outcome of an oracle, then we should embed that contract inside the market contract.

%facts [[5, Key, SerializedOracle]]
%If the oracle is undecided, amount = 1/2 delay = long, nonce = small
%If the oracle is decided, amount = 1 or 0, delay = 0, nonce = big.
