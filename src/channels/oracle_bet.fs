macro bet ( ProofStructure -- delay nonce amount )
%first unwrap the oracle data from the proof structure.
car drop

%next extract the result from the oracle

%1 means that the oracle returned true
int 1 == if drop drop 
     %delay, nonce, amount
     int 0 int 3 bet_amount else

%2 is false
drop int 2 == if drop drop 
     int 0 int 3 int 10000 bet_amount - else

% 3 means that the oracle decided that the question was a bad question to ask that does not have a clear binary answer.
drop int 3 == if drop drop 
     int 0 int 3 int 10000 MaxPrice - else

%0 means the oracle is still unresolved
drop int 0 == if drop drop 
     int 1 int 1 int 10000 MaxPrice - else
