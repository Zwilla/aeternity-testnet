install erlang version 18 or higher.
You may need to install from source http://www.erlang.org/downloads

Or use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```
brew install erlang
```

Use git to download the software, then go into the testnet directory
```
git clone https://github.com/aeternity/testnet.git
cd testnet
mkdir data blocks
```

Install the dependencies:
```
sh install.sh
```

Now you can run your node with ```sh start.sh```
