Trustless markets in financial derivatives are the goal of this software.
It is not a smart contract platform like Ethereum.
This software can only support smart contracts that can be built from financial derivatives.

By financial derivative, I mean a bet that is priced in the native tokens (AE for aeternity). The money being gambled is locked up until the winner is known. Neither participant in the bet has to trust the other.

These markets need to be scalable so that many people can participate. That is why they will exist off-chain on the channels.

[These markets need to do trading in batches, to avoid front running.](off_line_limit_order_channel.md)
